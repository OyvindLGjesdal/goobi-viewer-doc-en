# 3.7 Further Settings

Some additional parameters for indexing are explained below. 

#### 3.7.1 Parameters: addSortField 

If `true`, a second field is written in addition to the configured metadata field, which can be used to sort search hits. The second field has the prefix `SORT_` in its name. This is particularly useful for fields whose names begin with the prefix `MD_` \(`MD_` is replaced by SORT\_\). These are always configured in the Solr schema so that they can contain several values as a list - such fields cannot be used for sorting in Solr. Note that a sort field does not contain all values found, but only the first one \(for example, the first author of a record\). The default value is `false`. 

#### 3.7.2 Parameters: addSortFieldToTopstruct 

Special setting for metadata fields from LIDO events. If search hits are to be sorted by a metadata field from a LIDO event, the setting `true` writes a sort field from this metadata field into the document of the main element. The default value is `false`. 

#### 3.7.3 Parameters: addToDefault

If `true`, the value of the configured metadata field is appended to the `DEFAULT` field. The latter contains all tokens that can be searched for in the Goobi viewer. If a specific metadata is to be searchable, this option must be activated in the corresponding field configuration. The default value is `false`. 

#### 3.7.4 Parameters: addUntokenizedVersion

Metadata fields with the prefix `MD_` are always split into individual tokens \(roughly speaking, individual words in a character string\). To be able to browse a field \(see Browsing\), the entire character string must be present as a token \(otherwise, for example, you cannot browse main titles, but only individual words from main titles\). For this purpose, a copy can be created in addition to the metadata field, whose value exists as a token \(this receives the suffix `_UNTOKENIZED`\). Such fields can be configured for the Browse function. The default value is `true`.

#### 3.7.5 Parameter:Parameter: groupEntity

Individuals and entities may contain additional metadata, such as life data or external links. This metadata may be grouped to make it clear that they belong together. 

For this purpose, there is a possibility to write related metadata, e.g. of persons and corporations, in a separate Solr Index document. These can then be parsed by the Goobi viewer and graphically processed accordingly. 

If this configuration element is set to `true`, the following MODS structure is assumed for the relevant metadata field:

{% code title="mods.xml" %}
```markup
<mods:name type="personal" xlink:href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eike_von_Repgow  valueURI="http://d-nb.info/gnd/118529501">

      <mods:namePart type=”family”>&lt;von Repgow&gt;</mods:namePart>
      <mods:namePart type=”given”>Eike</mods:namePart>
      <mods:namePart type="date">1180 - 1233</mods:namePart>

      <mods:role>
            <mods:roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="code">aut</mods:roleTerm>
      </mods:role>

      <mods:displayForm>&lt;von Repgow&gt;, Eike</mods:displayForm>
</mods:name>
```
{% endcode %}

The configuration is done in the configuration element . This can optionally contain the type attribute \(permissible values: `PERSON`, `CORPORATION`, `LOCATION`, `SUBJECT`, `ORIGINFO`, `OTHER`\), which under certain circumstances can trigger a special treatment of the metadata in the Goobi viewer \(for example, displaying a person icon for search hits based on a person metadata\).

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<MD_AUTHOR>
    <list>
        <item>
            <xpath>
                <list>
                    <item>mets:xmlData/mods:mods/mods:name[@type="personal"][mods:role/mods:roleTerm="aut"[@authority='marcrelator'][@type='code']]</item>
                </list>
            </xpath>
            <groupEntity type="PERSON">
                <field name="MD_VALUE">mods:displayForm</field>
                <field name="MD_LINK">@xlink:href</field>
                <field name="MD_CORPORATION">mods:namePart[not(@type)]</field>
                <field name="MD_LASTNAME" defaultValue="Doe">mods:namePart[@type="family"]</field>
                <field name="MD_FIRSTNAME" defaultValue="John" multivalued="false">mods:namePart[@type="given"]</field>
                <field name="MD_LIFEPERIOD">mods:namePart[@type="date"]</field>
                <field name="NORM_URI">@valueURI</field>
            </groupEntity>
        </item>
    </list>
</MD_AUTHOR>
```
{% endcode %}

The individual metadata fields within the index document are configured in `<field>` elements. The attribute name describes the desired name of the index field within the document, the text value of the `<field>` element contains the XPath expression of the respective metadata. 

With the optional attribute `multivalued=false` only the first found value of the respective field can be transferred to the index. The default value is `true`. 

The optional attribute `defaultValue` can be used to write a default value if the XPath expression to which the attribute belongs does not return a value. To avoid that the default value is erroneously written in addition to the value from the XPath expression \(e.g. if a LIDO-XPath expression does not return a value when indexing METS\), it is best to configure separatem `<item>` elements for such constellations.

The XPath expressions are defined relative to the element found by the XPath expression in an `<item>` element. In the example above, the XPath expressions in  elements are relative to `<mods:name>`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any links are possible. The display mode with the Wikipedia symbol in the above example was configured in messages.properties \(see Metadata Configuration\). For technical reasons, however, only one display type can be configured per Solr field.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The MD\_VALUE subfield contains the "main value" of the metadata \(such as the names of persons, entities, and keywords\). It is mandatory for the grouped metadata to be included in the index.
{% endhint %}

If the configuration element is missing, a simple string with the name of the person or body is expected in `mods:displayForm`.

#### 3.7.6 Parameters: getnode 

If the value is set to `first`, the system aborts after the first value found for the current XPath expression. Note that several XPath expressions can be defined for a Solr field, for which values can also exist. 

#### 3.7.7 Parameters: getchildren 

If the value is set to `all`, values for this metadata are copied from all directly subordinate structure items. 

#### 3.7.8 Parameters: getparents 

If the value is set to `first`, values for this metadata are also copied from the directly superior force element. In `all` cases, values for this metadata are copied from all higher-level force elements up to the highest level. 

#### 3.7.9 Parameter: lowercase 

If this option is set to true, all uppercase letters in the string are replaced by lowercase letters. The default value is false. Example: 

```text
"Book Print" ==> "book print"
```

#### 3.7.10 Parameters: onefield 

If `true`, all values found will be written to the Solr field as one string. The values are separated by the string "`;` ". If `false`, a new string is written for each value. In the latter case, the relevant field in the Solr schema must be configured so that lists of several values are permitted. The default value is `false`.

With the optional attribute `separator`, the default separator `;` can be replaced by a self-defined one:

```markup
<onefield separator="#SPACE#">true</onefield>
```

#### 3.7.11 Parameter: onetoken / splittingCharacter

```text
Values (onetoken): true|false values
(splittingCharacter): any character string 
```

If the configuration element `onetoken` is set to `true`, the values are processed in such a way that Solr cannot split them into several tokens. In concrete terms, this means that non-alphanumeric characters are removed. The default value is false. Example 

```text
"Book Print, Hello World" ==> "BookPrintHelloWorld". 
```

If any character string in the element splittingCharacter is additionally configured for this field, all occurrences of this character string are replaced by a dot \(.\). Example:

```text
<splittingCharacter>#<splittingCharacter>
"Book#Print, Hello World"==> "Book.PrintHelloWorld"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
These configuration elements exist specifically for handling collection names in the Goobi viewer \(field DC\) and do not add value to other metadata fields.
{% endhint %}

#### 3.7.12 Parameters: normalizeYear 

This configuration element is intended for metadata fields that contain dates or years. If this element is set to '`true`', the Goobi viewer Indexer attempts to extract a normalized year \(`yyyy`\) from the value of this field. Currently, pure years and dates are recognized according to the patterns `dd.MM.yyyy` and `yyyy-MM-dd`. All recognized years are written into the field `YEAR` , `YEARMONTH` and `YEARMONTHDAY`. In addition, the respective century is calculated from these years and written into the `CENTURY` field. 

Both fields can be used, for example, for faceting search hits. However, since these are fields with several possible values per field, they cannot be used for sorting search hits. The default value is `false`. 

Optionally the attribute `<normalizeYear minYearDigits="n">` can be configured. The value `n` indicates the number of digits above which free-standing numbers in a character string are to be interpreted as years. Minimum value is 1. Default value is `3`.

#### 3.7.13 Parameter: replace 

This configuration element replaces individual ASCII characters or character strings with another character string. A character to be replaced is specified in the `char` attribute as an ASCII numeric code. Alternatively, a character string can be specified in the attribute `string` or a regular expression in the attribute `regex`. The character string to be written instead is specified within the element. 

Example 1:

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<replace char="10">&lt;br /&gt;</replace>
```
{% endcode %}

In the above example, an ASCII character for the line break \(10\) is replaced by the HTML character string for the line break.

{% hint style="info" %}
Eine Liste der ASCII-Zeichen finden Sie z.B. unter [https://ascii.cl/](https://ascii.cl/)
{% endhint %}

Example 2:

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<replace string="¬"></replace>
```
{% endcode %}

In this example, the non-sorting character '¬' is replaced by nothing \(it is removed\).

Example 3:

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<replace regex="(.*)\[(.*) (.*)\]">$1[$3 $2]</replace>
```
{% endcode %}

In this example, three groups are formed and the second and third are swapped within the square brackets, for example, "_The Holy Seat \[Max Mustermann\]_" would become "_The Holy Seat \[Mustermann Max\]_".

The placeholder `#SPACE#` is supported for spaces.

#### 3.7.14 Parameter: nonSortCharacters

As an alternative to replacing non-sorting characters \(see chapter 3.8.12\), this configuration element can be used to configure the detection of non-sorting parts for metadata and sort fields. For displayed metadata fields the non-sort characters are filtered out, for sort fields the entire part of the string discriminated against by the non-sort characters is removed. 

If the part that is not relevant for sorting is surrounded on both sides by non-sorting characters, for example `«` and `»`, `«` must be configured in the prefix attribute, `»` in the suffix attribute.

Example 1:

{% code title="mods.xml" %}
```markup
<mods:name>
    <mods:displayForm>«von» Goethe, Johann Wolfgang</mods:displayForm>
<mods:name>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<nonSortCharacters prefix="«" suffix="»" />
```
{% endcode %}

Result:

```text
<MD_TITLE>von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang</MD_TITLE>
<SORT_TITLE>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang<SORT_TITLE>
```

If the part not relevant for sorting is only separated from the rest of the string on one page, this character must only be configured as `prefix` \(non-relevant part at the beginning of the string\) or `suffix` \(non-relevant part at the end of the string\).

Example 2:

{% code title="mods.xml" %}
```markup
<mods:name>
    <mods:displayForm>von¬ Goethe, Johann Wolfgang</mods:displayForm>
<mods:name>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<nonSortCharacters suffix="\u00AC" />
```
{% endcode %}

Result:

```text
<MD_TITLE>von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang</MD_TITLE>
<SORT_TITLE>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang<SORT_TITLE>
```

#### 3.7.15 Parameters: addToChildren 

If this parameter is set to `true`, the values of this metadata are passed on to subordinate structure type documents. This is important, for example, for license types that use a Solr condition query. The field names used in the query must usually have this parameter activated. The DC field must always have this parameter activated. The default value is `false`. 

#### 3.7.16 Parameters: addToPages 

If this parameter is set to `true`, the values of this metadata are passed on to the page documents assigned to the respective structure hierarchy. This is important, for example, for license types that use a Solr condition query. The field names used in the query must usually have this parameter activated. And also metadata fields that are to be combined with full texts in the extended search. in the page documentsThe DC field must always have this parameter activated. The default value is `false`.

#### 3.7.17 Parameter: normalizeValue

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<normalizeValue length="5" filler="0" position="front" regex="foo([0-9]+).*$" />
```
{% endcode %}

Especially for sorting fields, it is sometimes necessary to normalize any numerical values contained in them in order to obtain correct sorting.

 Example: "foo1138bar" and "foo123bar". "123" is smaller as a number than "1138", but by string sorting the value is sorted after "1138", because "11" comes before "12". 

By using the configuration described above, the numerical value is filled to five digits: "foo00123bar" is sorted before "foo01138bar" after normalization.

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `length` | The desired number of characters in the normalized part of the string. |
| `filler` | A fill character that is used to fill up to the desired length. |
| `position` | Position at which the fill characters are appended. Possible values are `front` and `rear`. Default value is `front`. |
| `regex` | Optional regular expression to define the part relevant for normalization. Can contain up to one capture group \(otherwise the entire expression will be matched\). |

#### 3.7.18 Parameter: addToParents

If this parameter is set to tr`u`e; all metadata values found in subelements are moved to the main element \(both for simple and grouped metadata\). The default value is `false`.

#### 3.7.19 Parameter: geoJSONSource

This allows geocoordinates of points and polygons from [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language) or `mods:coordinates` to be written as [geoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) instead of in the original format. 

The following values are currently supported: 

* gml:Point \(points in "lon lat" format\)
* gml:Point:4326 \(points in "lat lon" format\)
* gml:Polygon \(points in "lon lat" format\)
* gml:Polygon:4326 \(points in "lat lon" format\)
* mods:coordindates/point

Optionally the attribute `addSearchField="true"` can be defined. In this case, the `WKT_COORDS` field is also written, which contains the coordinates of the point or polygon in [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format.

{% code title="solr\_indexerconfig.xml" %}
```markup
<MD_GEOJSON_POLYGON>
    <list>
        <item>
            <xpath>denkxweb:geoReference/denkxweb:surface/gml:MultiSurface[@srsName="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/epsg/0/4326"]/gml:surfaceMember/gml:Polygon/gml:exterior/gml:LinearRing/gml:posList</xpath>
            <geoJSONSource addSearchField="true">gml:Polygon:4326</geoJSONSource>
        </item>
    </list>
</MD_GEOJSON_POLYGON>
```
{% endcode %}

#### **3.7.20 Parameter: interpolateYears**

The switch `<interpolateYears />` can be used to specify whether years in the field `YEAR` should be interpolated. This is particularly useful if, when faceting by year, data records are also to be found for which no concrete year but a period was entered. The default value is 'false'.
