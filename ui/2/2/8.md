# 2.2.8 New record

## General 

Normally, Goobi viewer accepts records in `METS/MODS`, `LIDO` or `DenkXweb` format from external systems to index and display them. For small institutions, however, creating the formats is already a hurdle before working with the Goobi viewer. For this reason, the form on this page can be used to create standardised Dublin Core data sets including the corresponding images. 

## Overview

After an introductory text, the page is divided into two sections: "Metadata" and "Files".

### Metadata 

The only mandatory metadata in the form on this page is the title. A UUID is automatically generated in the background as the identifier. A drop-down menu with values is available for language and rights specifications. This allows, for example, valid ISO 639-2b language codes to be written without having to know them yourself. An inline help with further explanations is available for all fields. 

### Files 

In this section, images can be uploaded by dragging and dropping them onto the surface or classically by selecting a file. The file formats `TIFF`, `JPEG`, `JP2` and `PNG` are permitted. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The order of the file names later corresponds to the order of the files in the display. We therefore recommend file names such as 0001.tif, 0002.tif, 0003.tif.
{% endhint %}

After saving, the data is automatically indexed.
