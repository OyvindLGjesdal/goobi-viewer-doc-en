# 2.2.4 Access licenses

## General 

Access licences are used to control access to records. Records with access licences are automatically locked and therefore only visible to administrators until the licence has been configured. At this point, the default configuration is set, which applies to users without login.

For an application example, see also chapter 6.8: Configuring Access Restriction. 

## Overview 

The "Access Licences" page lists all configured access licences as tiles. If non-configured licences exist, this is prominently indicated at the top of the page.

![Overview of configured and indication of non-configured access licences](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui_2.2.4_1.png)

After the page heading, the functionality of the access licences is described again. Active and unassigned functions are marked as badges in the tiles. The colours of the badges follow the following scheme: 

* **Green**: The function is active 
* **Grey**: The function is not assigned and is therefore not available for data sets with this access licence. 

Below this, the area indicating the non-configured access licences appears as an option. 

The configured access licences are then displayed in a tile view. The tiles contain the following elements:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Element</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Headline</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">The internal value of the licence is displayed as a heading.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Note</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">If a licence is marked as Moving Wall or Open Access, a corresponding
        note is displayed. The same applies to licences that restrict simultaneous
        access or the percentage of a work that can be downloaded per user session.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Description</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">If a description has been entered for an access licence, it is visible
        in the tile.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Records</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">The number of records covered by this licence is indicated. Clicking on
        the number triggers a search for these works.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Rights holder</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">If a user, group or IP range has been assigned special rights for this
        licence, the rights holders are displayed here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Conditions</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">If a condition has been formulated for a licence, it is displayed here.
        Conditions must currently only be formulated for a moving wall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Functions</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>A list of active and unassigned functions is displayed here. Active functions
          are visualised as green badges. Unassigned functions are greyed out. If
          a licence is marked as &quot;Open Access&quot;, no functions are listed,
          as basically everything is allowed.</p>
        <p>If a licence concerns the display of annotations from a campaign, only
          the function &quot;View user-generated content&quot; is available.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you move the mouse over a tile, a link to edit or delete the access licence becomes visible.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting an access licence is only possible if it has no rights holder.

## Configure

When an access licence is configured, three sections are visible: "General" and "Functions" and "Overwriting access licences".

![The &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Functions&quot; and &quot;Overwriting Access Licences&quot; sections](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui_2.2.4_2.png)

## General

In the General section, the name is already occupied by the internal value of the access licence. A condition and the description are optional. 

## Functions

![Functions&quot; section](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui_2.2.4_3.png)

In the "Functions" section, you set what the access licence means. 

#### Open Access 

If a licence is marked as "Open Access", this means that access is unrestricted and available without authentication. 

### Moving Wall

If a licence is marked as "Moving Wall", the assigned functions are available for the period of restriction. After that, all other functions automatically take effect. A condition in the form of a Solr query must always be formulated for a moving wall. 

For an application example, see also Chapter 6.3: Moving Wall 

#### Functions

The "Functions" section is divided into two areas: the available functions and the assigned functions. By clicking on a badge, available functions can be added to the assigned functions and vice versa. 

The functions mean in detail:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **List record** | Controls the basic display of the record. If this function is active, the record is displayed with its metadata. If it is not active, the record is only visible to administrators. |
| **View Thumbnails** | This function can be used to display thumbnails of a record without the "View images" function. The threshold value up to which size an image is considered a thumbnail is set in the configuration file in the section. In the default configuration this is 400px image width. |
| **View images** | If active, access to high resolution images is allowed. This function overrides the "View Thumbnails" function. |
| **View Video** | If a record contains videos, access to them can be enabled or disabled. |
| **Listen to Audio** | If a record contains audio files, access to them can be enabled or disabled. |
| **View full text** | If full text is available for the dataset, for example in plain text, ALTO or TEI format, access to it can be controlled. |
| **Download files** | Controls access to additional files offered for download for datasets. These are visible in the "Downloads" widget in the sidebar of the record view. |
| **Download single page PDF** | This function can be used to still allow the generation of single page PDFs without the "Download PDF" function. |
| **Download PDF** | If active, all PDF download options are available. This function thus overrides the "Download single page PDF" function. |
| **Download Metadata** | This function can be used to control the download of metadata \(for example METS, LIDO, DublinCore, MARCXML, ...\) in the widget "Cite and repurpose". This restriction makes sense in combination with a moving wall, for example. If data sets are under a certain licence until the moving wall expires and then under another licence, the display in the interface can be manipulated differently from the values in the source files. In this case, access to the source files with the non-manipulated licence information should be prevented. |
| **Generate IIIF manifest** | Controls access to the IIIF manifest for a record. See also the further description on the Download Metadata function. |
| **View user-generated content** | If in a crowdsourcing campaign the results are licensed for access, then access to them can be controlled with this function. For example, access can be blocked in principle and only a dedicated user group can be given a corresponding right. |

It is also possible to limit the PDF download within a user session to a percentage of the work. For this, the percentage must be stored in the Solr field `ACCESSCONDITION_PDF_PERCENTAGE_QUOTA`.  
Furthermore, the simultaneous access to a work can be limited. For this purpose, the number of concurrent users must be stored in the Solr field `ACCESSCONDITION_CONCURRENTUSE`. 

If one of the two values exists, a box is displayed below the functions indicating the existence of the additional restriction option. It is indicated for how many data sets a value was recognised. The additional restriction can then be switched on or off in the box. 

### Overwriting Access Licences

If a work has several access licences, it is sufficient for a user to have a right for only one of these licences. One or more overwriting licences can be selected here.
