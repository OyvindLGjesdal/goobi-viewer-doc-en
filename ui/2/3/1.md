# 2.3.1 Campaigns

## Overview&#x20;

The "Campaigns" page lists all crowdsourcing campaigns in tabular form.

![Overview of crowdsourcing campaigns](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_2.3.1\_1.png)

To the right of the page heading is a button to add a new campaign.&#x20;

Above the table there are two areas:&#x20;

* **Left**: A paginator. A maximum of 15 entries are displayed in the table. If a hit set contains more than these 15 entries, you can navigate through the hits there.&#x20;
* **Right**: A search slot. Searches are made in the name of the campaign&#x20;

The table shows the name of the campaign in the first column. The second column shows whether the campaign is publicly visible or restricted to a user group. The third column shows whether the campaign has been restricted to a certain period of time. The fourth column shows various statistics about the campaign.&#x20;

If you move the mouse over a table row, a link to edit or delete the campaign becomes visible in the first column.&#x20;

## Add&#x20;

### General&#x20;

When a new campaign is added, only the "General" section with a tab display is available at first. The default language is at the top. This is followed by the tabs for the activated translations.

![General" section and "Settings" and "Review" sidebar widget](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_2.3.1\_2.png)

In the standard language, the mandatory fields Title and Solr-Query must be filled in before the text can be entered for a translation. Since the media file and the Solr query are the same for all languages, these items are deactivated in the translations. Partially completed translations are visualised via an orange tab colour. Fully completed translations are indicated by a green tab colour.

### Questions&#x20;

As soon as a Solr query has been filled in, the second section "Questions" appears. Here, any number of questions can be added for the campaign. The following elements are available per question:

| Element                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Question**                   | The specific question is asked here, for example "Which persons can be recognised?". Multilingualism is realised via horizontal tabs.                                                                                                          |
| **Type**                       | <p>The question type determines what the result for the question looks like. The following options are available:</p><ul><li>Text (long)</li><li>Text (formatted)</li><li>Map</li><li>GND authority data identifier</li><li>Metadata</li></ul> |
| **Metadata**                   | This element is only available for the question type "Metadata". If a metadata selected here already contains a value, it will be displayed in the campaign. If it is empty, it can be added via an input box.                                 |
| **Belongs to**                 | <p>Determine to which part of the work the result of the question refers. Available are:</p><ul><li>Entire record</li><li>Page</li><li>Image area</li></ul>                                                                                    |
| **Number of possible answers** | <p>Specify here how many answers to the question are allowed. Available are: </p><ul><li>one</li><li>several</li></ul>                                                                                                                         |

![Questions" section and sidebar widgets "Access Licence", "Log" and "Statistics](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_2.3.1\_3.png)

### Sidebar&#x20;

Five widgets are available in the sidebar:&#x20;

1. Settings
2. Review
3. Access licence
4. Log
5. Statistics

#### Settings

The visibility of the campaign can be defined in the settings. If it is public, any user can participate in it. Private campaigns can be released for a user group and/or a defined period of time.

If it is released for a user group, it is only visible to the selected user group. The owner of the group is also the owner of the campaign and can edit it.&#x20;

If the campaign is released for a defined period of time, it is publicly visible to everyone for that period of time. However, if it is restricted to a user group at the same time, it is only visible to this user group for that period.

#### Review

Entered contents are checked in a review by default. The process can be restricted to a user group or turned off completely.&#x20;

#### Access licence

Campaign results can be given an access licence to restrict visibility. The control then takes place via the [Access Licences](../2/4.md) and [Rights](../2/5.md) sections. If no licence is assigned, the results are directly visible.&#x20;

#### Log

With the log, it is possible to save additional messages. It is displayed within the campaign, refers to the displayed work and is visible to all. For example, answers to a question can be explained in more detail.&#x20;

#### Statistics&#x20;

The statistics contain the following key figures about the campaign:&#x20;

* Progress in percent
* Absolute number of records included
* Number of completed records
* Number of records under review
* Number of different people who have contributed to the campaign
