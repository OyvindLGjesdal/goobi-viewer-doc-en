# 2.4.3 Static pages

## General

On the "Static Pages" page, pages from the Goobi viewer Core can be overwritten with a CMS page while retaining the URL. These CMS pages are automatically marked with an orange "Static page" badge.

## Edit

The "Static pages" page shows a form in tabular form

![The &quot;Static pages&quot; page](../../../.gitbook/assets/ui_2.4.3.png)

The first column of the table shows the name of the page in the Goobi viewer Core. The second column shows the address from which the page is accessed. In the third column, an overwriting CMS page can be selected.

Below the table there is a button for saving.
