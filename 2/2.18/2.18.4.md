# 2.18.4 Blacklist

It sometimes happens that certain collections already exist in the index, but should not \(yet\) be made available to the public. In this case, they can be placed on the collections blacklist:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field=”DC”>
        <blacklist>
            <mode>all</mode>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
        </blacklist>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Once a collection has been blacklisted, it \(and all subcollections\) will no longer be listed in the collection overview. All works that belong to at least one blacklisted collection will be filtered out. 

The collection names in the blacklist are the raw names of the collections \(not the names in `messages_*.properties`\). The collection names must be written exactly as they are in the index \(usually small throughout\). The element `<mode>` defines whether the blacklist should only be applied to the collection listing \(value "`dcList`"\) or generally \(value "`all`"\). In the latter case, works that belong to a blacklisted collection are also not searchable and are not listed in the RSS feed. Default value is `all`.
