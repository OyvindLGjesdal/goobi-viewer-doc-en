# 2.18.4 Blacklist

It sometimes happens that certain digital collections are already present in the Solr search index but should not yet be displayed. In this case, you can use the collection blacklist:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field=”DC”>
        <blacklist>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
        </blacklist>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endcode %}

Once a digital collection is on this list, it is no longer displayed in the collection overview, including all subcollections. All records that belong to at least one blacklisted collection are filtered out in search queries. 

The collection names in the blacklist are the raw names of the collections \(that is, not the names in `messages_*.properties`\). The collection names must be written exactly as they are in the index.
