# 2.18.5 Displaying the collection size

The size of a collection is the number of records it contains. In the collection overview, this number is displayed in parentheses after the name of the individual hierarchy level of the collection. 

This configuration element is available if you do not want this display or only want it from one of the lower hierarchy levels:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field=”DC”>
        <displayNumberOfVolumesLevel>1</displayNumberOfVolumesLevel>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endcode %}

The number `displayNumberOfVolumesLevel` stands for the highest hierarchy level for which the collection size is to be displayed. 0 is the highest level, 1 is the second level, and so on. If the hierarchy level is higher than this, the size is not displayed. 

If you do not want the size to be displayed for any hierarchy level, you can configure an unrealistic number that is greater than the hierarchy depth \(about 999\). The default value is `0`.
