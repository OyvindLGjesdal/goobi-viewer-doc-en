# 2.18.3 Sorting of collections

By default, your collections are sorted alphabetically by their names in the collection overview \(that is, not by the names in `messages_*.properties`\). However, it is possible to define your own sequence. 

The following configuration determines how the collections are sorted:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field=”DC”>
        <sorting>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
        </sorting>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endcode %}

Collections \(raw names\) that are listed here are listed first and in the specified order. All other collections are listed behind it in the standard sort \(see above\). 

It is possible to sort certain parts of the collections. For this you can group the `<collection>` tags in a `<sortingList>`:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field=”DC”>
        <sorting>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
            <sortingList sortAfter=”collection2”>
                <collection>collection3</collection>
                <collection>collection4</collection>
            </sortingList>
        </sorting>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endcode %}

The attribute `sortAfter` specifies the name of the collection behind which the collections listed in the `sortingList` are to be sorted. 

If the collection specified in `sortAfter` has subcollections, but the first collection listed in the `sortingList` is on the same or a higher hierarchy level as the `sortAfter` collection, the collections of the sortingList are also sorted after all subcollections of the `sortAfter` collection.

If collections listed in `<collections>` have subcollections that are not contained in the sort list, they are sorted alphabetically within the listed collection.
