# 2.26 Reading lists

The Goobi viewer has the functionality of the reading lists. Non-registered users can save records on a list within their session and send them by e-mail if required. 

Authenticated users can maintain and persistently save various reading lists. 

The functionality can be switched on or off globally with the following switch:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<bookmarks>
    <bookmarksEnabled>true</bookmarksEnabled>
</bookmarks>
```
{% endcode %}

The field `BOOKMARKS` in the advanced search must be configured for the search in the records of a reading list. See also [chapter 2.17.3](2.17/2.17.3.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
This functionality was formerly known as "bookshelves" and was renamed "reading lists".
{% endhint %}
