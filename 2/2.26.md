# 2.26 Reading lists

The Goobi viewer has the functionality of the watch lists. Non-registered users can save records on a list within their session and send them by e-mail if required. 

Authenticated users can maintain and persistently save various watch lists. 

The functionality can be switched on or off globally with the following switch:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<bookshelves>
    <bookshelvesEnabled>true</bookshelvesEnabled>
</bookshelves>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This functionality was formerly known as "bookshelves" and was renamed "reading lists".
{% endhint %}
