# 2.19.7 Calendar structure elements

To ensure that a calendar view is also available for certain structure elements, these must be included in the following list:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<metadata>
    <calendarDocstructTypes>
        <docStruct>newspaper</docStruct>
    </calendarDocstructTypes>
</metadata>
```
{% endcode %}
