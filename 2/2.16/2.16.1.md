# 2.16.1 External themes

The default theme for the Goobi viewer is the compiled application. However, it can also be extracted outside the application context, for example as a checked-out Git repository. 

To do this, a `<rootPath>` with the absolute path to the themes folder must be defined as a sub-element of the theme entry:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <theme mainTheme="MYTHEMENAME" 
           discriminatorField="" />
</viewer>
```
{% endcode %}

This path must also be defined in the context of the application within the Tomcat as a `PreResource`:

{% code title="context.xml" %}
```markup
<Context>
    <Resources>
        <PreResources 
            className="org.apache.catalina.webresources.DirResourceSet"
            base="/opt/digiverso/viewer/themes/MYTHEMENAME/MYTHEMENAME/WebContent/resources/themes"
            webAppMount="/resources/themes" />
    </Resources>
</Context>
```
{% endcode %}
