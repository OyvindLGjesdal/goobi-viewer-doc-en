# 2.17.4 Timeline

The Goobi viewer's year search provides an introduction to the content that works in the same way as the calendar entry. The year search can be configured in the following section:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
    <timeline>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <startyear>1500</startyear>
        <endyear>2013</endyear>
        <hits>108</hits>
    </timeline>
</search>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

The switch `<enabled>` switches the year search on or off. Possible values for `startyear` and `endyear` are whole years \(also minus\) as well as for start year further the value MIN and for end year the value MAX. For MIN, the smallest available year is taken from the index as the start value, for MAX, the largest available year is taken as the end year. The number of hits for the timeline is defined in `hits`. MAX is also allowed as a value here.
