# 2.17.1 Sorting

The sorting of the search hit list can be configured as follows:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
     <sorting>
           <enabled>true</enabled>
           <defaultSortField>DATECREATED</defaultSortField>
           <luceneField>SORT_CREATOR</luceneField>
           <luceneField>SORT_TITLE</luceneField>
           <luceneField>SORT_YEARPUBLISH</luceneField>
           
            <static>
                 <field>BOOL_PRIORITIZE</field>
           </static>
     </sorting>
</search>
```
{% endcode %}

The `<enabled>` element can be used to completely disable sorting \(default value is `true`\). The `<luceneField>` elements  define the Solr fields by which the sorting can be done. The order of the list corresponds to the displayed order. If a sort field is to be used immediately during the first search before the user has selected an explicit sort, this can be defined in the element `<defaultSortField>`.

An additional static sort field list `<static>` can be used to place certain records at the top based on the presence of a certain index field. The fields configured here are applied in the sort order before the normal sort fields and are not visible to the user.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The fields used for sorting must not be fields with multiple values \(that is, in their declaration in `/opt/digiverso/viewer/apache-solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml`, the multiValued attribute must not have the value true\).
{% endhint %}
