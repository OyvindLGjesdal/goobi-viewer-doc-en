# 2.17.1 Sorting

The sorting of the search hit list can be configured as follows:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
     <sorting>
           <enabled>true</enabled>
           <defaultSortField>DATECREATED</defaultSortField>
           <luceneField>SORT_CREATOR</luceneField>
           <luceneField>SORT_TITLE</luceneField>
           <luceneField>SORT_YEARPUBLISH;SORT_TITLE</luceneField>
           
            <static>
                 <field>BOOL_PRIORITIZE</field>
           </static>
     </sorting>
</search>
```
{% endcode %}

With the element `<enabled>` the sorting can be switched off completely \(default value is `true`\). The elements `<luceneField>` define the Solr fields, according to which the sorting can be done. The order of the listing corresponds to the displayed order. 

If a sort field is to be used immediately in the first search before the user has selected an explicit sort, it can be defined in the element `<defaultSortField>`. 

Several sort fields can be specified one after the other, separated by semicolons. An example is shown in the above code block with `SORT_YEARPULISH;SORT_TITLE`. This means that the hits are first sorted by `SORT_YEARPUBLISH`. The records that do not contain the metadata are listed below according to `SORT_TITLE`.

An additional static list of sort fields `<static>` can be used to always place certain works on top based on the presence of a certain index field. The fields configured here are applied in the sort order before the normal sort fields and are not visible to the user.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The fields used for sorting must not be fields with multiple values \(that is, in their declaration in `/opt/digiverso/viewer/apache-solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml`, the multiValued attribute must not have the value true\).
{% endhint %}
