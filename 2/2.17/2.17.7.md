# 2.17.7 Boosting of whole records in the relevance sorting

With this setting works and complete records can be placed in the search results before all other search hits \(subordinate structure elements, full text hits\). Complete works corresponding to the search query are listed at the top, followed by volumes and independent works \(monographs, etc.\). All other search hits follow. The default value is `true`.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
    <boostTopLevelDocstructs>true</boostTopLevelDocstructs>
</search>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

This option has no effect on the aggregated search hit display.
