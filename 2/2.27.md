# 2.27 User comments

Authenticated users can leave comments on individual pages. The functionality can be switched on and off globally with the `<enabled>` element. In addition, it is possible to restrict the comment function to works that fulfill a defined condition. This condition is defined as Solr query in the `<conditionalQuery>` element. If one or more e-mail addresses are to be notified when a new comment is added, they can be configured with the repeatable element `<notificationEmailAddress>`.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<userComments>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
    <conditionalQuery>DC:varia</conditionalQuery>
    <notificationEmailAddress>user@example.org</notificationEmailAddress>
</userComments>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
