# 2.5.3 Further settings

Regardless of the selected authentication type, the registration of new accounts or the reset password can be deactivated. The following switch is used for this purpose:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<user>
    <userRegistrationEnabled>true</userRegistrationEnabled>
</user>
```
{% endcode %}

A security question is asked when registering new local user accounts. There is a section `<securityQuestions />` in the configuration file for this:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<user>
    <securityQuestions>
        <question key="user__security_question__1">
            <allowedAnswer>blau</allowedAnswer>
            <allowedAnswer>blue</allowedAnswer>
        </question>
        <question key="user__security_question__2">
            <allowedAnswer>6</allowedAnswer>
            <allowedAnswer>sechs</allowedAnswer>
            <allowedAnswer>six</allowedAnswer>
        </question>
        <question key="user__security_question__3">
            <allowedAnswer>b</allowedAnswer>
            <allowedAnswer>t</allowedAnswer>
        </question>
    </securityQuestions>
</user>
```
{% endcode %}

Each `<question />` contains the attribute `key=""` in which a message key is defined. In this way, the questions can always be displayed in the correct language. Per question there is a list of allowed answers \(`<allowedAnswer />`\). This way even answers from different languages can be displayed correctly. 

Each user can enter further question and answer combinations via the configuration file. Further suggestions are:

* What is Max Mustermann's first name?
* When is the Easter Bunny coming?
* What number comes after 1, 2, 3?
