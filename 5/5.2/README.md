The Goobi viewer has an integrated content management system, hereinafter referred to as CMS, with which users can create static content such as pages or navigation menus and edit them subsequently. To do this, the user must be logged into the Goobi viewer and the user account must have administrative rights. 

The CMS functions can be accessed via the administration backend of the Goobi viewer via the Administration link in the main menu. The main CMS functions, divided into five points, are Page overview, Create new page, Collections main menu and Media. These are described in detail in the following subchapters.
