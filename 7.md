# 7. FAQ

## How can I find out how old my Goobi viewer is?

 In the source code of the page, the meta tag with the attribute name="version" is located at the very beginning. The content of the attribute content gives information about the age of the code base.

```markup
<meta name="version" content="Goobi viewer-3.2-20180719-5b53620" />
```

 "**Goobi viewer**" is the product name, "**3.2"** the internal version number. "**20180719**" corresponds to the date when the Goobi viewer was compiled. "**5b53620**" are the first seven characters of the git commit hash used for compilation. The date is a good first indicator. 

For example, you can search for the Git commit hash on GitHub to find out the exact state of the application.

## How can I re-index my entire database? 

For the re-indexing of the entire database, the contents of the indexed\_mets folder must be copied into the hotfolder:

```bash
 cp /opt/digiverso/viewer/indexed_mets/*.xml /opt/digiverso/viewer/hotfolder/ 
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before copying, make sure that the hotfolder is empty so that no potentially corrected records are overwritten with an older version from the indexed\_mets folder. 
{% endhint %}

## Which web browsers are supported by the Goobi viewer? 

The Goobi viewer supports all so-called "evergreen browsers". These are the current versions of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge). 

Older versions, especially Internet Explorer 11, have not been officially supported since mid-July 2018. 

## Which databases are supported by the Goobi viewer? 

The Goobi viewer supports the [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) databases for productive use and [H2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_%28DBMS%29) for the Goobi to go environment. 

[Oracle Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database), [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) and [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) databases are currently not possible.

## The file system with the Goobi viewer data is full, can I delete any of it?

If the file system on which the data of the Goobi viewer is stored is full, usually `/opt/digiverso/`, then the following folders can be emptied without problems:

* `updated_mets/`
* `deleted_mets/`
* `error_mets/`

For the meaning of the directories see [Chapter 3.2.](3/3.2.md)

The following folders can also be checked:

* `abbyy/`  The files in this folder have been automatically converted to ALTO by the Goobi viewer Indexer since [October 2017](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-digests-de/2017/10#speicherverbrauch). The Goobi viewer itself only uses the ALTO. If the data was imported via Goobi workflow, it is available there and can be deleted in the Goobi viewer.
* `pdf/` The PDF documents stored in this folder are delivered with a PDF download from the Goobi viewer. If there are no files here, \(if configured\) a PDF with optional text is generated from the image and optional ALTO file and delivered. The result is the same, only the delivery time may take longer.  For the PDF files generated in this way, there is a cache under `cache/pdf.data`, so that PDF documents that have been generated once are stored there up to a cache size of 100GB.

## How can I compile the Goobi viewer?

The theme is compiled and the core is included as a dependency. Therefore, the following steps describe how to check out the Reference theme and compile a viewer.war:

* If not already done, maven must be installed: 

```text
sudo apt install maven
```

* Then check out the theme: 

```text
mkdir -p /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes
cd /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes
git clone https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-theme-reference.git
```

* Now compile the application: 

```text
cd /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes(goobi-viewer-theme-reference/goobi-viewer-theme-reference/
mvn package
```

At the end, the compiled Goobi viewer is located in the `target/viewer.war` folder.
