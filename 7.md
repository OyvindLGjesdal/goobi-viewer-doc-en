## How can I find out how old my Goobi viewer is?

 In the source code of the page, the meta tag with the attribute name="version" is located at the very beginning. The content of the attribute content gives information about the age of the code base.

```markup
<meta name="version" content="Goobi viewer-3.2-20180719-5b53620" />
```

 "**Goobi viewer**" is the product name, "**3.2"** the internal version number. "**20180719**" corresponds to the date when the Goobi viewer was compiled. "**5b53620**" are the first seven characters of the git commit hash used for compilation. The date is a good first indicator. 

For example, you can search for the Git commit hash on GitHub to find out the exact state of the application.

## How can I re-index my entire database? 

For the re-indexing of the entire database, the contents of the indexed\_mets folder must be copied into the hotfolder:

```bash
 cp /opt/digiverso/viewer/indexed_mets/*.xml /opt/digiverso/viewer/hotfolder/ 
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before copying, make sure that the hotfolder is empty so that no potentially corrected records are overwritten with an older version from the indexed\_mets folder. 
{% endhint %}
