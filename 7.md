# 7. FAQ

## How can I find out how old my Goobi viewer is?

In the source code of the page there are various meta tags at the very beginning, which provide information about the age and code base of the version used:

```markup
<meta name="generator" content="Goobi viewer" />
<meta name="version" content="4.6.0" />
<meta name="public version" content="20.04" />
<meta name="build date" content="2020-05-08 05:44" />
<meta name="git-revision" content="dd0bea0" />
```

"**Goobi viewer**" is the product name, "**4.6.0**" the version number. "**2020-05-08 05:44**" is the date when the application was compiled. "**dd0bea0**" are the first seven characters of the git commit hash used to compile the application. 

The date is a good first indicator. The git-commit hash can be searched for on GitHub, for example, to find out exactly what state the application is at.

## How can I re-index my entire database? 

For the re-indexing of the entire database, the contents of the indexed\_mets folder must be copied into the hotfolder:

```bash
 cp /opt/digiverso/viewer/indexed_mets/*.xml /opt/digiverso/viewer/hotfolder/ 
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before copying, make sure that the hotfolder is empty so that no potentially corrected records are overwritten with an older version from the indexed\_mets folder. 
{% endhint %}

## Which web browsers are supported by the Goobi viewer? 

The Goobi viewer supports all so-called "evergreen browsers". These are the current versions of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge). 

Older versions, especially Internet Explorer 11, have not been officially supported since mid-July 2018. 

## Which databases are supported by the Goobi viewer? 

The Goobi viewer supports the [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) databases for productive use and [H2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_%28DBMS%29) for the Goobi to go environment. 

[Oracle Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database), [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) and [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) databases are currently not possible.

## The file system with the Goobi viewer data is full, can I delete any of it?

If the file system on which the data of the Goobi viewer is stored is full, usually `/opt/digiverso/`, then the following folders can be emptied without problems:

* `updated_mets/`
* `deleted_mets/`
* `error_mets/`

For the meaning of the directories see [Chapter 3.2.](3/3.2.md)

The following folders can also be checked:

* `abbyy/`  The files in this folder have been automatically converted to ALTO by the Goobi viewer Indexer since [October 2017](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-digests-de/2017/10#speicherverbrauch). The Goobi viewer itself only uses the ALTO. If the data was imported via Goobi workflow, it is available there and can be deleted in the Goobi viewer.
* `pdf/` The PDF documents stored in this folder are delivered with a PDF download from the Goobi viewer. If there are no files here, \(if configured\) a PDF with optional text is generated from the image and optional ALTO file and delivered. The result is the same, only the delivery time may take longer.  For the PDF files generated in this way, there is a cache under `cache/pdf.data`, so that PDF documents that have been generated once are stored there up to a cache size of 100GB.

## How can I compile the Goobi viewer?

The theme is compiled and the core is included as a dependency. Therefore, the following steps describe how to check out the Reference theme and compile a viewer.war:

* If not already done, maven must be installed: 

```text
sudo apt install maven
```

* Then check out the theme: 

```text
mkdir -p /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes
cd /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes
git clone https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-theme-reference.git
```

* Now compile the application: 

```text
cd /opt/digiverso/viewer/themes(goobi-viewer-theme-reference/goobi-viewer-theme-reference/
mvn package
```

At the end, the compiled Goobi viewer is located in the `target/viewer.war` folder.

## How's working with Git and Branches?

There is a `Master` branch that is always stable and installable. 

There is also a so-called `Develop` branch, which contains new functions but cannot be completely stable yet. 

The Develop branch is used for `feature_` branches in which new functionality is developed. As soon as these are finished, they are merged into the Develop branch and from time to time the developments flow back from the Develop branch into the stable Master branch.

## How does versioning work in the Goobi viewer?

The Goobi viewer and its components have a version number consisting of three digits, for example **4.2.0**.

 The first digit in the version number is the main version. In the foreseeable future, this will remain on number **4**. This is the so-called `Major` version. So the current Goobi viewer is version 4! 

The second digit denotes the so-called `Minor` version and is always incremented when a finished work package from development is included in a release. In the above example the minor version is the 2.

The third digit indicates the `patch level`. If a bug should occur in the stable master branch and a bugfix release should be necessary, then this is added directly to the master and the patch level is counted up. In the example above the 0. 

Besides the stable versions there are also development versions. These are always a minor version higher than the last stable version and always end in `-SNAPSHOT`. Based on the example above, the next development version would be `4.3.0-SNAPSHOT`.
