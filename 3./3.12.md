# 3.12 Deleting orphaned anchor records

Should it happen that the Solr Index contains empty Anchor documents \(i.e. multi-volume works without volumes\) due to incorrect imports, these can be removed from the index in one go. The following command is available for this purpose:

```text
cd /opt/digiverso/indexer
java -jar solrIndexer.jar solr_indexerconfig.xml -cleanupGrievingAnchors
```
