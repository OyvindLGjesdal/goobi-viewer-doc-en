#### 3.3.1 Parameters: metsFileSizeThreshold 

Size of a METS file in bytes from which an alternative write method is to be applied to the Solr Index in order to avoid memory overflows in very large records. The default value is `10485760`. 

#### 3.3.2 Parameters: dataFolderSizeThreshold 

Size in bytes of any data folder from which an alternative write method is to be applied to the Solr Index in order to avoid memory overflows in very large records. The default value is `157286400`. 

#### 3.3.3 Parameters: autoOptimize 

Automatic optimization of the Solr Index after each indexing. If a document is deleted from the Solr index, it is initially marked as deleted and otherwise remains in the index. An optimization of the index completely removes documents marked as deleted in order to reduce the index size and performs further defragmentation measures. This improves performance. Since optimization is a resource-intensive operation, it should normally only be performed sporadically. The default value is `false`. 

#### 3.3.4 Parameters: threads 

If the value is higher than 1, page documents are generated in parallel threads. The default value is `1`.
