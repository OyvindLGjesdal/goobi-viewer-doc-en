# 6.7 Configuration of the deputy image for restricted access

If the image display in the Goobi viewer is prevented by an access condition, a deputy image is displayed. 

The path to this image is configured in the messages file using the following key: 

```text
noImage_accessDenied
```

The default entry is as follows: 

{% code title="messages\_\*.properties" %}
```text
noImage_accessDenied=<img src\="/viewer/resources/images/access_denied.png" />
```
{% endcode %}

The key can be overwritten in the local messages files. This allows individual images or texts to be displayed that are different for each language.
