# 6.12 Multilingualism

The Goobi viewer Core is available in German, English, Spanish, French and Arabic. If available, the interface is automatically displayed in the language that the browser has defined as the default language. Language support is independent of whether a language switch is also offered in the interface. 

Which languages are also available in the instance is configured in the `faces-config.xml` of the respective theme. 

Here is an example of the file from the Goobi viewer theme boilerplate:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="faces-config.xml" %}
```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<faces-config 
	xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd"
	version="2.0">
	<application>
		<locale-config>
			<default-locale>de</default-locale>
			<supported-locale>en</supported-locale>			
			<supported-locale>de</supported-locale>			
			<supported-locale>es</supported-locale>			
		</locale-config>
	</application>
</faces-config>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

The `default-locale` defines the language that should be displayed if the browser language does not appear in the list of `supported-locale`. 

The `supported-locale` list specifies which languages should be available. The `supported-locale` list also defines the list of language tabs in the CMS backend. For example, to allow only the German language, simply remove the entries for `en` and `es` from the `supported-locale` in the theme. 

See in this context also chapter 2.19.10 multilingual metadata.
