# 6.8.1 License types

License types must be created in the admin backend of the Goobi viewer. A license type defines the standard behavior of records with the corresponding access condition for normal users \(i.e. users who are not administrators or so-called licensees and do not come from privileged IP ranges\).

The menu item "Licenses" takes you to the list of existing license types. In order to create a new license type, the creation mask must be opened via the link "Add new license type". This has the following input fields:

| **Field** | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | The name of the license type must correspond to the corresponding Access Condition \(case sensitive\). |
| **Description** | Free text description of this license type. |
| **Conditions** | An optional Solr query to restrict the scope of this license type to specific records. This means that the configured restrictions of this license type apply only to records that correspond to this query. All other records will ignore the settings of this license type. It is also possible to include conditions for downloading files depending on the file name in this field. You can enter a regular expression in the form `FILENAME:{<regular expression>`}. All downloadable files whose file name matches the regular expression will be protected by the license type. Other files are excluded. This expression can be entered alone or additionally - separated by spaces - under the normal Solr query conditions. |
| **OpenAccess** | If a license type is defined as Open Access, all configured restrictions are ignored and the work can be viewed freely. |
| **Default privileges** | Standard authorizations apply to all users. All rights not selected here must be explicitly assigned as a license. |
| **List work** | This authorization controls the overall visibility of records. If this permission is not granted, the records do not appear in search results, are not listed in collections, and cannot be opened \(the user is notified that the work in question does not exist\). |
| **View images** | Image display in normal and full screen mode. |
| **View thumbnails** | Display of thumbnails of the records concerned \(search results and page view\). |
| **View fulltext** | Full text view of the records concerned. |
| **View video** | Video display in normal and full screen mode |
| **Listen to audio** | Audio player in normal and full screen mode |
| **Download PDF** | Generate PDF documents from the relevant records. |
| **Single page PDF download** | Download single page PDF files |
| **Download files** | Download source files associated with the record \(for example, Born Digital documents\). |

After creation, the new license type is listed on the `Licenses` page. There it can be opened for editing or deleted.

{% hint style="info" %}
The static license types `Set representatives` and `Delete OCR pages` are required for the corresponding functions of the Goobi viewer and cannot be changed or deleted.
