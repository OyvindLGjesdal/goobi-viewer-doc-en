# 6.14 Search for coordinates

Since version 4.6, the Goobi viewer has supported searching for coordinates. GML points and polygons \(as in DenkXweb\) and mods:coordinates can be indexed as geoJSON and displayed on maps. Furthermore, faceting queries for searching for points, points in polygon, polygon intersections can be passed directly in the URL. For this purpose the coordinates are indexed as WKT. 

In order to allow as many faceting options as possible, the entire WKT query must be formulated in the client \(e.g. in JavaScript\). Examples are: 

* Search by point: `https://viewer.example.org/search/-/-/1/-/WKT_COORDS: "Intersects(POINT(9.86929194928373 51.8163517626803)) distErrPct=0"/` 
* Contained in polygon \(for example points\): `https://viewer.example.org/search/-/-/1/-/WKT_COORDS: "IsWithin(POLYGON((0 0, 0 90, 90 90, 90 0, 0 0)) distErrPct=0"/` 
* Partially contained in polygon \(for example, other polygon\): `https://viewer.example.org/search/-/-/1/-/WKT_COORDS: "Intersects(POLYGON((0 0, 0 90, 90 90, 90 0, 0 0)) distErrPct=0"/` 
* Not included in the polygon: `https://viewer.example.org/search/-/-/1/-/WKT_COORDS: "IsDisjointTo(POLYGON((0 0, 0 -90, -90 -90, -90 0, 0 0)) distErrPct=0"/`

Further information on indexing is provided in [chapter 3.7.19](../3/3.7.md#3-7-19-parameter-geojsonsource).
