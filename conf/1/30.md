# 1.30 Original content

Your Goobi viewer offers you the option of making files on a record available as direct downloads. These can be, for example, original versions of Born-Digital documents.&#x20;

To do this, the folder for original content `origContentFolder` must first be configured (see [chapter 1.3](3.md)). The files are stored within this folder in subfolders that have the identifier of the record as folder name (e.g. `/opt/digiverso/viewer/source/PPN123456789/born_digital.pdf`). For each file in this subfolder a download link is generated in the record view.

![A file is additionally offered for download in the sidebar](../../.gitbook/assets/conf\_1.17.9\_and\_1.30.png)

It is also possible to exclude certain files from the listing in the sidebar. This is a purely visual adjustment, access and download is still possible.

The functionality can be controlled in the configuration file with the following switches:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<sidebar>
     <sidebarWidgetDownloads enabled="true">
          <hideFileRegex>(EXAMPLE_.*|HIDDEN_.*)</hideFileRegex>
     </sidebarWidgetDownloads>
</sidebar>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is currently not possible to delete documents from Goobi workflow or the Goobi viewer. This can only be done manually directly in the file system.
{% endhint %}
