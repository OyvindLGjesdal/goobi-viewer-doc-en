# 1.27 User comments

Authenticated users can leave comments on individual pages. The functionality can be switched on and off globally with the attribute `enabled`. In addition, it is possible to restrict the comment function to record that fulfill a defined condition. This condition is defined as Solr query in the `<conditionalQuery>` element. If one or more e-mail addresses are to be notified when a new comment is added, they can be configured with the repeatable element `<notificationEmailAddress>`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<comments enabled="true">
    <conditionalQuery>DC:varia</conditionalQuery>
    <notificationEmailAddress>user@example.org</notificationEmailAddress>
</comments>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
