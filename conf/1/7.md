# 1.7 Access conditions and images

If necessary, the display of images of some records can be blocked by means of an access licence. However, it may be desired to display small thumbnails of the images anyway. For this purpose, a maximum image width can be defined up to which the access permission `View images` is not required, but the permission `View thumbnails` is sufficient (default value is 120):

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<accessConditions> 
    <thumbnailImageAccessMaxWidth>150</thumbnailImageAccessMaxWidth>
</accessConditions>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If this value is set too high, this is tantamount to de facto undermining the access restriction!
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to make the normal image display accessible, but to limit the permitted image resolution. Such a restriction always deactivates the zoom function at the same time. In the configuration, the maximum picture width that can be called up without the 'Image zoom' authorisation can be set for this. The default value for this configuration is 0; in this case, no restriction applies.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<accessConditions> 
    <unzoomedImageAccessMaxWidth>600</unzoomedImageAccessMaxWidth>
</accessConditions>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Users who access the Goobi viewer interface from localhost can be automatically assigned administrator rights for access restrictions. This is controlled by the following switch:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<accessConditions> 
    <fullAccessForLocalhost>true</fullAccessForLocalhost>
</accessConditions>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
