# 1.7 Unlimited access to thumbnails of restricted images

The image display of some records may be blocked to the public on request. Also in this case it can make sense to make small thumbnail versions of the images accessible to all. For this purpose, a maximum image width can be defined up to which the access restriction does not apply \(default value is `120`\):

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<accessConditions> 
    <unconditionalImageAccessMaxWidth>150</unconditionalImageAccessMaxWidth>
</accessConditions>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If this value is set too high, it would be the same as removing the access restriction.
{% endhint %}

Users who access the Goobi viewer interface from localhost can be automatically assigned administrator rights for access restrictions. This is controlled by the following switch:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<accessConditions> 
    <fullAccessForLocalhost>true</fullAccessForLocalhost>
</accessConditions>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
