# 1.17.4 Timeline

The Goobi viewer offers an entry point to the content with the timeline. It can be configured in the following section:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
    <timeline enabled="true">
        <startyear>1500</startyear>
        <endyear>2013</endyear>
        <hits>36</hits>
    </timeline>
</search>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The attribute `enabled` switches the timeline on or off. Possible values for `startyear` and `endyear` are whole years \(also minus\) as well as for start year further the value `MIN` and for end year the value `MAX`. For `MIN`, the smallest available year is taken from the index as the start value, for `MAX`, the largest available year is taken as the end year. The number of hits for the timeline is defined in `hits`. `MAX` is also allowed as a value here.
