# 1.17.7 Boosting of whole records in the relevance sorting

With this setting records and anchor records can be placed in the search results before all other search hits \(subordinate structure elements, full text hits\). Anchor records corresponding to the search query are listed at the top, followed by volumes and independent records \(monographs, etc.\). All other search hits follow. The default value is `true`.

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
    <boostTopLevelDocstructs>true</boostTopLevelDocstructs>
</search>
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This option has no effect on the aggregated search hit display.
{% endhint %}
