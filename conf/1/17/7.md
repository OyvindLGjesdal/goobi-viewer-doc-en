# 1.17.7 Expand query for search sub-results

With this switch, an expand query can be built for search sub-results from current faceting, even if no concrete search terms have been entered. For example, sub-elements of a record can also be listed via the collection navigation. Default value is `false`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<search>
    <useFacetsAsExpandQuery>false</useFacetsAsExpandQuery>
</search>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
