# 1.19.12 Licenses

When new records are created in the backend, a list of licenses is available. This list can be configured in the following place:

{% code title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<metadata>
    <licenses>
          <license label="Creative Commons: CC0 1.0" icon="" url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" />
    </licenses>
</metadata>
```
{% endcode %}

Each license has a label and a URL. The label is displayed and the URL is stored in the background. An icon is planned, but is not supported yet.
