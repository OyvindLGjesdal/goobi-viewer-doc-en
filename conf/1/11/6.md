# 1.11.6 Restriction of image scaling

The intranda ContentServer, i.e. the component that loads the requested image data and delivers it to the Goobi viewer, has the ability to scale any image as desired. This is quite positive in theory. However, image data that is too large can use up the available RAM, which can have a negative effect on performance. To avoid this, there are possibilities to limit the maximum image size (in pixels) or the maximum zoom level:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <maxImageWidth>2000</maxImageWidth>
    <maxImageHeight>2000</maxImageHeight>
    <maxImageScale>500</maxImageScale>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
