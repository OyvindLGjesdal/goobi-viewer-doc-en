# 1.11.5 External images

External images are normally passed directly to the client in the image display. Sometimes, however, it makes sense to retrieve them from the intranda ContentServer and have them delivered by the Goobi viewer itself. A list of URLs can be defined for this functionality. If an external URL applies to one of the configured URLs, the described logic applies:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <externalContent>
        <restrictedUrls>
            <url>https?://external/restricted/.*</url>
            <url>https?://external/noaccess/.*\.tif</url>
        </restrictedUrls>
    </externalContent>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
