# 1.11.4 Maintaining zoom and rotation while browsing in the image view

Optionally, the last used zoom level and rotation of the image display can be retained when scrolling within a record. This then applies to all types of zoomed image display within a record and a user session. In particular, the zoom level and rotation are retained even when switching between normal image display and full screen view. 

The required configuration is:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <rememberImageZoom>true</rememberImageZoom>
    <rememberImageRotation>true</rememberImageRotation>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
