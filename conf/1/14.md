# 1.14 Full text hints

If a record contains only a few selected full-text pages, the search for them can be very difficult. This may be the case, for example, if only individual pages of a manuscript have been transcribed so far.&#x20;

For this reason, the Goobi viewer can display hints in the page preview and image display. When browsing through the full text pages, only the pages containing the full text are then displayed.&#x20;

The display depends on the percentage value of the available full texts in relation to the total number of available images in the record. The option to set the threshold value is as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <fulltextPercentageWarningThreshold>30</fulltextPercentageWarningThreshold>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
