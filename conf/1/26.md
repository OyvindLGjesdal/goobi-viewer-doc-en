# 1.26 Reading lists

The Goobi viewer has the functionality of the reading lists. Non-registered users can save records on a list within their session and send them by e-mail if required.&#x20;

Authenticated users can maintain and persistently save various reading lists.&#x20;

The functionality can be switched on or off globally with the following switch:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<bookmarks enabled="true" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The field `BOOKMARKS` in the advanced search must be configured for the search in the records of a reading list. See also [chapter 1.17.3](17/3.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
This functionality was formerly known as "bookshelves" and was renamed "reading lists".
{% endhint %}
