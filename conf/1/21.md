# 1.21 Tag clouds

Large amounts of data in the index can significantly reduce the speed of tag cloud generation. 

In such cases, it is possible to reduce the sample size for individual tag cloud fields. For this purpose, a sub-element with the name of the index field as name and the desired sample size as value is entered in the `sampleSizes` configuration element:

{% code title="config\_viewer-xml" %}
```markup
<tagclouds>
     <sampleSizes>
          <MD_TITLE>5000</MD_TITLE>
     </sampleSizes>
</tagclouds>
```
{% endcode %}
