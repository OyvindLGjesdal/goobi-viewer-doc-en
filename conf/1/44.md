# 1.44 ActiveMQ

There is a queue in the Goobi viewer for background tasks. ActiveMQ is used for this.&#x20;

The queue can be switched on and off with the following configuration. It is also possible to define the number of tasks that can be executed in parallel.

```xml
<activeMQ enabled="true" numberOfParallelMessages="2" />
```
