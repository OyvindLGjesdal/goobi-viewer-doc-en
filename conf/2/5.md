# 2.4 Structure types

Structure types can be automatically replaced by others in the index, if desired. To do this, these structure elements are entered in the following configuration list:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_indexer.xml" %}
```markup
<docstructmapping>
    <useDefaultDocstruct>false</useDefaultDocstruct>
        <list>
            <_default>OtherDocStrct</_default>
            <Gemälde>Painting</Gemälde>
            <Münze>Coin</Münze>
    </list>
</docstructmapping>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The `_default` element contains the default structure type (see below). All other entries define patterns according to which structure types are to be replaced. The name of the XML element contains the original name of the structure type. The content of the XML element contains the character string that is to replace the original name. In the above example, the structure type `Münze is replaced by coin`.&#x20;

The configuration element `useDefaultDocstruct` determines how to deal with structure types that are not explicitly mapped in the configuration file. If `true`, the structure type is replaced by the standard structure type (`<_default>`). With `false`, the structure element is taken over as it is (however, spaces are replaced by underscores).
