# 2.3 Performance

The performance can be influenced by some parameters:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_indexer.xml" %}
```markup
<performance>
    <metsFileSizeThreshold>10485760</metsFileSizeThreshold>
    <dataFolderSizeThreshold>157286400</dataFolderSizeThreshold>
    <autoOptimize>false</autoOptimize>
    <threads>4</threads>
    <countHotfolderFiles>true</countHotfolderFiles>
</performance>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The parameters are explained in detail in the following table:

| Setting                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **metsFileSizeThreshold**   | Size of a METS file in bytes from which an alternative write method is to be applied to the Solr Index in order to avoid memory overflows in very large records. The default value is `10485760`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **dataFolderSizeThreshold** | Size in bytes of any data folder from which an alternative write method is to be applied to the Solr Index in order to avoid memory overflows in very large records. The default value is `157286400`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **autoOptimize**            | Automatic optimization of the Solr Index after each indexing. If a document is deleted from the Solr index, it is initially marked as deleted and otherwise remains in the index. An optimization of the index completely removes documents marked as deleted in order to reduce the index size and performs further defragmentation measures. This improves performance. Since optimization is a resource-intensive operation, it should normally only be performed sporadically. The default value is `false`.  |
| **threads**                 | If the value is higher than 1, page documents are generated in parallel threads. The default value is `1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **countHotfolderFiles**     | If the value is `true`, the remaining number of objects in the hotfolder is reported to the Goobi viewer via the REST API when the indexer is started and after each indexed object. In case of very large file sizes (for example a complete re-indexing) and a slow memory connection, the functionality can be turned off, as otherwise the counting can take a significant amount of time. The default value is `true`.                                                                                       |
