# 3.1.12 Sets

It is possible to define your own sets using a Solr query.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config\_oai.xml" %}
```markup
<sets>
      <allValuesSet translate="true">DC</allValuesSet>
      <set setName="Digital collection foo" setSpec="foo" setQuery="+DC:foo +(ISWORK:true ISANCHOR:true)" />
      <set setName="Monographs" setSpec="monographs" setQuery="+DOCSTRCT:monograph +(ISWORK:true ISANCHOR:true)" />
      <set setName="Single identifier" setSpec="id" setQuery="PI:AC1234567" />
</sets>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

A set always consists of `setName`, `setSpec` and `setQuery`. `setName` is a label for the set. This value is also displayed in the OAI-PMH interface. `setSpec` is the internal name used to address the set. This name is also used within GET requests, so it should not contain any special characters. `setQuery` defines the search query to be used. The complete Solr syntax can be used.

Additionally there is the possibility to create a set for each existing value of an index field \(for example all collection names\). For this an element `allValuesSet` is defined, which has the corresponding Solr field name as text value.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some fields like `DC` or `DOCSTRCT` are written to all Solr documents in a record.  
This means that only filtering for them is not sufficient. To filter only records and anchor records that meet this condition, the following constraint must be added to the Solr query: `+(ISWORK:true ISANCHOR:true)`.
{% endhint %}
